# Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing and modeling housing data in India. Using Python, the notebook performs data exploration, visualization, and machine learning to uncover patterns in the dataset and build predictive models. Steps are taken to mitigate overfitting, ensuring better model generalization on unseen data.

# Data Import
Libraries Used:
NumPy for numerical computations.
Pandas for data manipulation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
The dataset (Intern Housing Data India.csv) is loaded using pandas.read_csv.

# Data Exploration
The structure of the dataset is examined using:
data.info() to view data types and non-null counts.
data.head() to preview the first few rows.
data.shape to understand the dimensions.

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Missing values are handled
